   - Create model relationships
   - Add serialization for local storage

3. Develop Repository Layer with Mock Data:
   - Implement repositories with interfaces that can later be swapped with real API implementations

             }
             
             return rooms
         }
         
         // Get room by ID
         suspend fun getRoomById(roomId: String): Room? {
             MockNetworkDelay.execute()
             
             val rooms = mockDataRepository.getRooms()
             return rooms.firstOrNull { it.id == roomId }
         }
         
         // Other repository methods
     }
     ```

### Next Steps:

1. Continue implementation of remaining repositories:
   - BookingRepository
   - ReviewRepository
   - PaymentRepository

2. Implement ViewModels with LiveData/StateFlow:
   - UserViewModel
   - RoomViewModel
   - BookingViewModel
   - ReviewViewModel

3. Create UI layouts and implement fragments:
   - Start with login/registration screens
   - Implement home screen with room listing
   - Create room details screen
   - Add booking flow screens

4. Implement session management:
   - Create secure mock login system
   - Add persistent session storage
   - Implement session timeout handling

This modified approach will allow us to build a fully functional application with realistic data without requiring a backend. When the backend is ready, we can replace the mock data sources with actual API calls while keeping the rest of the architecture intact.

## 2025-09-25: Implemented Mock Data Infrastructure

As planned in our modified implementation strategy, I've now completed the core mock data infrastructure that will allow us to develop the app without waiting for backend dependencies. This approach provides realistic data for testing and development while maintaining the ability to easily switch to real API endpoints later.

### Completed Tasks:

1. Created MockDataProvider Class:
   - Implemented in `utils/MockDataProvider.kt`
   - Provides methods to generate realistic sample data for all entities
   - Includes random data generation for users, rooms, bookings, reviews, etc.
   - Creates realistic relationships between entities
   - Generates geographically accurate location data
   - Provides proper price ranges based on room types
   - Implements helper methods for common data generation needs

2. Implemented FileBasedMockDataRepository:
   - Created in `utils/FileBasedMockDataRepository.kt`
   - Manages persistence of mock data to local files
   - Uses Gson for JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Handles file IO operations with proper error handling
   - Implements CRUD operations for all entity types
   - Automatically initializes with sample data on first run
   - Provides methods to query data with filtering

3. Created MockNetworkDelay Utility:
   - Implemented in `utils/MockNetworkDelay.kt`
   - Simulates realistic network delays for API operations
   - Provides different delay characteristics based on operation type
   - Includes configurable error simulation
   - Implements coroutine-friendly delay execution
   - Generates realistic network error scenarios

### Integration with Existing Code:

The mock data infrastructure has been designed to work seamlessly with the existing repository implementations. Each repository now has the option to use the FileBasedMockDataRepository instead of making actual API calls. This approach allows us to:

1. Test all app functionality without a backend
2. Generate consistent test data
3. Simulate various error scenarios
4. Develop offline functionality
5. Easily switch to real API when available

The mock data approach includes simulated network delays to provide a realistic user experience, including loading states and error handling, just as would be required with a real API.

### Example Repository Usage:

```kotlin
class RoomRepository(
    private val context: Context,
    private val mockDataRepository: FileBasedMockDataRepository
) {
    // Get available rooms with filtering
    suspend fun getAvailableRooms(filter: RoomFilterModel): List<Room> {
        // Simulate network delay
        MockNetworkDelay.execute(MockNetworkDelay.OperationType.FETCH)
        
        // Get rooms from mock repository
        var rooms = mockDataRepository.getRooms()
        
        // Apply filters
        if (filter.checkInDate != null && filter.checkOutDate != null) {
            rooms = rooms.filter { it.isAvailableBetween(filter.checkInDate, filter.checkOutDate) }
        }
        
        // Apply other filters...
        
        return rooms
    }
}
```

### Next Steps:

1. Complete remaining repository implementations by updating them to use the mock data
2. Update ViewModels to work with the mock data repositories
3. Begin implementing UI components that will display the mock data
4. Create the main navigation flow of the application

This mock data infrastructure provides a solid foundation for continuing development without backend dependency, while ensuring we can easily integrate with the real API when it becomes available.

## 2025-10-02: Revised Implementation Strategy - Backend-Independent Development

After reviewing our implementation approach, we've decided to remove the mock data infrastructure and focus on components that can be developed without backend dependencies. This change will simplify the codebase and reduce maintenance overhead when real backend endpoints become available.

### Implementation Revision:

1. Removed Mock Data Infrastructure:
   - Deleted MockDataProvider class
